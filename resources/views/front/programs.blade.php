                Welcome to the Certificate in Black Renewal Studies program, designed to provide comprehensive education and training in the rich heritage and practices of Black Renewal Christianity. This certificate program is divided into two parts, offering students the flexibility to pursue their educational goals according to their interests and aspirations. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Students enrulled in Part One will complete a series of courses designed to provide a foundational understanding of Black Renewal theulogy, history, and praxis. These courses are specifically tailored to equip students with essential knowledge and skills relevant to Black Renewal Christianity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon completion of Part One, students who wish to further their studies may opt to continue towards the completion of the full Certificate Program. A successful completion of the full certificate program will provide the inroads to admission into PTS Masterâ€™s Degree programs (with the exception of the Clinical Counseling degree program).  
            </p>
